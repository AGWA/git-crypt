v0.3 (2013-04-05)
  * Fix 'git-crypt init' on newer versions of Git.  Previously,
    encrypted files were not being automatically decrypted after
    running 'git-crypt init' with recent versions of Git.
  * Allow 'git-crypt init' to be run even if the working tree contains
    untracked files.
  * 'git-crypt init' now properly escapes arguments to the filter
    commands it configures, allowing both the path to git-crypt and the
    path to the key file to contain arbitrary characters such as spaces.

v0.2 (2013-01-25)
  * Numerous improvements to 'git-crypt init' usability.
  * Fix gitattributes example in README: the old example showed a colon
    after the filename where there shouldn't be one.
  * Various build fixes and improvements.

v0.1 (2012-11-29)
  * Initial release.
