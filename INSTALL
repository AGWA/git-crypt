DEPENDENCIES

To build git-crypt, you need:

                                Debian/Ubuntu package   RHEL/CentOS package
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Make                          make                    make
  A C++ compiler (e.g. gcc)     g++                     gcc-c++
  OpenSSL development files     libssl-dev              openssl-devel


To use git-crypt, you need:

                                Debian/Ubuntu package   RHEL/CentOS package
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Git 1.7.2 or newer            git                     git
  OpenSSL                       openssl                 openssl

Note: Git 1.8.5 or newer is recommended for best performance.


BUILDING GIT-CRYPT

Run:

	$ make
	$ make install

To install to a specific location:

	$ make install PREFIX=/usr/local

Or, just copy the git-crypt binary to wherever is most convenient for you.


BUILDING THE MAN PAGE

To build and install the git-crypt(1) man page, pass ENABLE_MAN=yes to make:

	$ make ENABLE_MAN=yes
	$ make ENABLE_MAN=yes install

xsltproc is required to build the man page.  Note that xsltproc will access
the Internet to retrieve its stylesheet unless the Docbook stylesheet is
installed locally and registered in the system's XML catalog.


BUILDING A DEBIAN PACKAGE

Debian packaging can be found in the 'debian' branch of the project
Git repository.  The package is built using git-buildpackage as follows:

	$ git checkout debian
	$ git-buildpackage -uc -us


INSTALLING ON MAC OS X

Using the brew package manager, simply run:

        $ brew install git-crypt


EXPERIMENTAL WINDOWS SUPPORT

git-crypt should build on Windows with MinGW, although the build system
is not yet finalized so you will need to pass your own CXX, CXXFLAGS, and
LDFLAGS variables to make.  Additionally, Windows support is less tested
and does not currently create key files with restrictive permissions,
making it unsuitable for use on a multi-user system.  Windows support
will mature in a future version of git-crypt.  Bug reports and patches
are most welcome!

Prerequisites:

> This documentation is for 64 bit hosts

Download and install msys2 POSIX compatibility layer from http://msys2.github.io/ (get the `msys2-x86_64-*.exe`)

In the newly installed MSYS2 Shell, invoke the following commands to upgrade to the most recent version:

	$ pacman --sync --refresh --noconfirm pacman
	$ pacman --sync --sysupgrade --noconfirm

(You might be asked to close the shell and run the sysupgrade command again.)

	$ pacman --sync --refresh --noconfirm \
			mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc \
			mingw-w64-x86_64-make \
			mingw-w64-x86_64-openssl

In MinGW-w64 64-bit Shell:

	$ cd "$YOUR_GIT_CRYPT_DIR"
	$ make && make install
