BUILDING GIT-CRYPT

Run:

	$ make
	$ make install

To install to a specific location:

	$ make install PREFIX=/usr/local

Or, just copy the git-crypt binary to wherever is most convenient for you.


BUILDING A DEBIAN PACKAGE

Debian packaging can be found in the 'debian' branch of the project
Git repository.  The package is built using git-buildpackage as follows:

	$ git checkout debian
	$ git-buildpackage -uc -us


INSTALLING ON MAC OS X

Using the brew package manager, simply run:

        $ brew install git-crypt


EXPERIMENTAL WINDOWS SUPPORT

git-crypt should build on Windows with MinGW, although the build system
is not yet finalized so you will need to pass your own CXX, CXXFLAGS, and
LDFLAGS variables to make.  Additionally, Windows support is less tested
and does not currently create key files with restrictive permissions,
making it unsuitable for use on a multi-user system.  Windows support
will mature in a future version of git-crypt.  Bug reports and patches
are most welcome!
