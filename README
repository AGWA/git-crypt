ABOUT GIT-CRYPT

git-crypt enables transparent encryption and decryption of files in a
git repository.  Files which you choose to protect are encrypted when
committed, and decrypted when checked out.  git-crypt lets you freely
share a repository containing a mix of public and private content.
git-crypt gracefully degrades, so developers without the secret key can
still clone and commit to a repository with encrypted files.  This lets
you store your secret material (such as keys or passwords) in the same
repository as your code, without requiring you to lock down your entire
repository.

BUILDING GIT-CRYPT

See below for dependencies.  The Makefile is tailored for g++.  If you
have a different compiler, edit Makefile and change the CXX and CFLAGS
variables.  This will be made easier in a future release.

	$ make
	$ cp git-crypt /usr/local/bin/

It doesn't matter where you install the git-crypt binary - choose wherever
is most convenient for you.


DEPENDENCIES

To use git-crypt, you need:

	* Git 1.6.0 or later
	* OpenSSL
	* For decrypted git diff output, Git 1.6.1 or later
	* For decrypted git blame output, Git 1.7.2 or later


USING GIT-CRYPT

Generate a secret key:

	$ git-crypt keygen /path/to/keyfile

Configure a repository to use encryption:

	$ cd repo
	$ git-crypt init /path/to/keyfile

Specify files to encrypt by creating a .gitattributes file:

	secretfile filter=git-crypt diff=git-crypt
	*.key filter=git-crypt diff=git-crypt

Like a .gitignore file, it can match wildcards and should be checked
into the repository.  Make sure you don't accidentally encrypt the
.gitattributes file itself!

Cloning a repository with encrypted files:

	$ git clone /path/to/repo
	$ cd repo
	$ git-crypt init /path/to/keyfile

That's all you need to do - after running git-crypt init, you can use
git normally - encryption and decryption happen transparently.
