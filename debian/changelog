git-crypt (0.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix 'git-crypt init' on newer versions of Git.  Previously,
    encrypted files were not being automatically decrypted after
    running 'git-crypt init' with recent versions of Git.
  * Allow 'git-crypt init' to be run even if the working tree contains
    untracked files.
  * 'git-crypt init' now properly escapes arguments to the filter
    commands it configures, allowing both the path to git-crypt and the
    path to the key file to contain arbitrary characters such as spaces.
