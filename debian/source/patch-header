Subject: Collected Debian patches for git-crypt
Author: Andrew Ayer <agwa@andrewayer.name>

Since I am also upstream for this package, there will normally not be
any patches to apply to the upstream source.  However, occasionally
I'll pull up specific upstream commits prior to making an upstream
release.  When this happens, this patch will collect all of those
modifications.

I use Git to maintain both the upstream source and the Debian
packages, and generating individual patches rather than using git
cherry-pick takes extra work for no gain.  Since I'm also upstream,
there's no need to separate the patches for later upstream submission.
Hence, I take this approach with a unified patch when it's necessary.

For full commit history and separated commits, see the upstream Git
repository.
