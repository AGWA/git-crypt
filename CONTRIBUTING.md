Thanks for your interest in contributing to git-crypt!  git-crypt is
open source software and welcomes contributions in the form of code,
documentation, bug reports, or anything else that improves git-crypt.

When contributing code, please consider the following guidelines:

 * You are encouraged to open an issue on GitHub to discuss any non-trivial
   changes before you start coding.

 * Please mimic the existing code style as much as possible.  In
   particular, please indent code using tab characters with a width
   of 8.

 * To minimize merge commits, please rebase your changes before opening
   a pull request.

 * To submit your patch, open a pull request on GitHub.

Finally, be aware that since git-crypt is security-sensitive software,
the bar for contributions is higher than average.  Please don't be
discouraged by this, but be prepared for patches to possibly go through
several rounds of feedback and improvement before being accepted.
Your patience and understanding is appreciated.
